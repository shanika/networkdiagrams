# Nodes and Figures

Nodes are graphical objects that can be arranged in a diagram page. These nodes can 
be added to the diagram page either programmatically or during run time by dragging 
them from a symbol selector.

The shapes for these nodes can be set to any one of the predefined shapes provided. 

The main different between nodes and figures is that nodes can have ports, figures not.

You can also design these shapes using a symbol designer utility (source code included in the 
download package).
